Description: Adds a new expert level, offensive alteration/destruction mix spell, “Death’s Embrace”, to the game. 

You can buy the spell tome from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold. You will need the Expert Alteration perk to purchase it.

The spell has a mix of alteration and destruction, but the game engine, the Creation Kit, registers it as alteration. So when you have the spell, look for it under alteration.

Spell:
Deals fire, shock, and frost damage.
Paralyzes the target for some time.	

This spell may be overpowered. I haven’t done much testing other than playing modded Legendary mode. For reference, I killed a frost troll with about two Death’s Embrace hits on Legendary mode. That being said, I tagged this as a cheat mod (Nexus), as I personally feel like this spell makes some enemies easier to kill.
